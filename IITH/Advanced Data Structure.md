## How Algorithms Should work: (Students Opinion)
- Correctness -> It should Provide Correct Data
- Good Space & Time Complexity
- Finite Steps / Operations
- Unambiguous -> Clear / Precise
- Should not be Hardware or Software Dependent
- Must Have output
## Deterministic & Randomize Algorithms

### **Deterministic Algorithm:**
- Always gives the same result for the same input.
- Steps are fixed and predictable.

  **Examples:**
  - **Bubble Sort:** Always sorts the same list in the same way.
  - **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Always finds the shortest path in a graph with fixed weights.

### **Randomized Algorithm:**
- Uses randomness as part of its logic.
- Can give different results or take different steps on the same input.

  **Examples:**
  - **Randomized Quick Sort:** Uses a randomly chosen pivot, which can lead to different performance on the same data.
  - **Monte Carlo Method:** Uses random sampling to solve problems that might be deterministic in nature.

### LLM Example:
Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 can exhibit both deterministic and randomized behavior, depending on how they are used:

- **Deterministic Mode:**
  - When configured with a fixed random seed, the model produces the same output for the same input every time.
  - This can be useful for debugging and testing.

- **Randomized Mode:**
  - When no fixed seed is set, the model's outputs can vary for the same input due to the inherent randomness in the sampling process.
  - This allows for more diverse and creative responses.

In practice, **LLMs often operate in a randomized mode** to provide varied and contextually rich responses.

## Extra

- Sorting Algo
- Lower / Upper Bound -> 
	- Lower Bound Lowest Time needed (Best Time Complexity) $$ \Omega = Omega $$
	- Upper Bound Max Time Needed (Worst Time Complexity)
	  $$ O = Big O $$
	- Average Time Complexity
	  $$\theta = Theta(Average \space Time \space Complexity)$$
