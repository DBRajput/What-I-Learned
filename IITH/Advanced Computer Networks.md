## Network Edge

### Component

- All **Devices:** such as 'Mobile, Camera, PC' that are connected at end of Network. 
- **Equipment:** Routers, switches, access points. 
- **Function:** Facilitates the entry and exit of data to and from the network, connecting end-users to the network core.
### Edge Computing

**Edge Computing** is a distributed computing paradigm where data processing and storage occur closer to the data source (Mini Processing Devices) or end-users rather than in a centralized data center. It can help to complete the small tasks which require real time changes, Later on that data can be sent to the cloud for later on usage.

**Key Points:**

- **Reduces Latency:** By processing data locally, it minimizes the delay caused by transmitting data to distant servers.
- **Improves Performance:** Enhances the speed and efficiency of applications, especially for real-time data processing.
- **Increases Reliability:** Reduces dependency on central servers, improving resilience to network outages.
- **Use Cases:** IoT devices, autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and remote monitoring systems.

## Packet Switching

**Packet Switching** is a method of data transmission where data is broken into small packets and sent independently over a network. 

**Key Points:**
- **Data Division:** Large messages are divided into smaller packets.
- **Routing:** Packets are sent via different paths and reassembled at the destination.
- **Efficiency:** Utilizes network resources more efficiently and handles variable traffic loads.
- **Reliability:** Ensures data delivery even if some packets are lost or delayed, with retransmission mechanisms.
### Types of Delays in Packet Switching

**Packet Delay** refers to the time it takes for a data packet to travel from its source to its destination in a network. It includes several components:

1. **Transmission Delay:** Time required to push the packet's bits into the transmission medium.
	- In the context of `packet delay`, **L / R** represents a simplified formula to calculate the transmission delay:
		- **L**: Packet Length (in bits)
		- **R**: Transmission Rate (in bits per second or bps)
			- **Transmission Delay Formula:**
				$$ Transmission Delay = \frac{L}{R} $$
				> This formula calculates the time it takes to push the entire packet of length **L** into the network link with a rate of **R** bits per second. For example, if a packet is 1,000,000 bits long and the transmission rate is 1,000,000 bps, the transmission delay would be 1 second.
				> 
2. **Propagation Delay:** Time for a packet to travel through the physical medium (e.g., cables, fiber optics).
3. **Queuing Delay:** Time a packet spends waiting in queue at network devices (e.g., routers, switches) before being processed.
4. **Processing Delay:** Time needed for routers or switches to process the packet's header and routing information.

Total packet delay is the sum of these delays and affects overall network performance and user experience.

## Services & Protocols of Internet

- `Protocol` define the format, order of message sent/received among network entities & action it tool on message transmission receipt
- **Duplex** refers to the mode of communication in a network:
	- **Simplex:** One-way communication (e.g., radio broadcasts).
	- **Half-Duplex:** Two-way communication, but not simultaneous (e.g., walkie-talkies).
	- **Full-Duplex:** Two-way communication, simultaneous (e.g., telephone conversations).

### **Internet Services:**

1. **Web Browsing:** Access and view web pages.
2. **Email:** Send and receive electronic mail.
3. **File Sharing:** Transfer files between systems.
4. **Domain Name Resolution:** Convert domain names to IP addresses.
5. **Remote Access:** Access and control systems from a distance.
6. **Streaming Media:** Deliver audio and video content in real-time.

### **Internet Protocols:**

1. **HTTP/HTTPS:** Protocols for web page transfer; HTTPS includes encryption.
2. **SMTP:** Protocol for sending emails.
3. **POP3/IMAP:** Protocols for retrieving and managing emails.
4. **FTP/SFTP:** Protocols for file transfer; SFTP includes encryption.
5. **DNS:** Protocol for resolving domain names to IP addresses.
6. **Telnet/SSH:** Protocols for remote system access; SSH is secure.
7. **RTSP/RTP:** Protocols for streaming media delivery.
