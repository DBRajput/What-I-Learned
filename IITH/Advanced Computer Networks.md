## Network Edge

### Component

- All **Devices:** such as 'Mobile, Camera, PC' that are connected at end of Network. 
- **Equipment:** Routers, switches, access points. 
- **Function:** Facilitates the entry and exit of data to and from the network, connecting end-users to the network core.
### Edge Computing

**Edge Computing** is a distributed computing paradigm where data processing and storage occur closer to the data source (Mini Processing Devices) or end-users rather than in a centralized data center. It can help to complete the small tasks which require real time changes, Later on that data can be sent to the cloud for later on usage.

**Key Points:**

- **Reduces Latency:** By processing data locally, it minimizes the delay caused by transmitting data to distant servers.
- **Improves Performance:** Enhances the speed and efficiency of applications, especially for real-time data processing.
- **Increases Reliability:** Reduces dependency on central servers, improving resilience to network outages.
- **Use Cases:** IoT devices, autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and remote monitoring systems.
