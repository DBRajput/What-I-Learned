# FoML - 01

## What is Machine Learning:
- It's Model which makes prediction & decisions based/from data.
- A computer Program which is said to learn experience E from past & perform task F using past experiences & we use this E and F Tasks Experience to do new Tasks.

> Traditional Program
> Data+Program => Compute => Output

> Machine Learning Program
> Data+Output => Compute => Program

## Where ML is not required:
- Where no data or very low data is present
- when there is specific input/output already present (Discrete Algo)

## Supervised Learning:

- Predict 'Y' when given an input 'X' (X: Labelled data):
	- For Categorical Y: Classification
		- Discrete Values, e.g. Male or Female, we give input X with Tag 
	- For Real-Valued Y: Regression

## Unsupervised Learning:

- Predict 'Y' when given raw data input 'X' (Non Labelled data):
	- Create an internal representation of the input (e.g. Clustering, dimensionality)
	- This is imp in machine learning as getting labelled data is expensive & difficult.
