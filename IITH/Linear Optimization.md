## Linear Optimization

- **Meaning:** A mathematical method for finding the best outcome (maximum or minimum) in a model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships.
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - **Objective Function:** The function to be maximized or minimized.
  - **Constraints:** Linear inequalities or equations that limit the possible solutions.
  
**Example:**
- **Maximizing Profit:** Determining the best mix of products to produce to maximize profit given constraints like limited resources or production capacity.
## Matrix Theory

- Matrix theory helps in organizing and solving linear optimization problems efficiently.
- It uses matrices to represent linear equations and inequalities, making it easier to perform calculations and find optimal solutions.
