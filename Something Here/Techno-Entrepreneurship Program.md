## Problem Statement:

Schools in India often struggle to manage student data effectively, leading to delays in providing important information to parents.
There's a lack of personalized learning strategies and career guidance for students, which can hinder their academic growth. Rural students, in particular, face challenges in accessing quality educational content. Our education portal aims to solve these problems by providing schools with a user-friendly platform to manage student data efficiently. It will offer personalized learning recommendations to improve student performance and career guidance based on their interests. Additionally, the portal will make educational content accessible to all students, regardless of their location or background.

## Idea:

Our startup aims to create a comprehensive education portal for schools, serving as a centralized platform for managing student data, including exam scores, assignments, attendance information, and teacher remarks. This platform will provide parents with real-time updates on their children's progress.

Utilizing AI tools, we will analyze student performance to identify strengths and weaknesses. Based on this analysis, we will recommend personalized strategies for improvement and provide sample exams to enhance learning outcomes. The AI system will also assess faculty performance by analyzing student scores in specific subjects and collecting feedback.

Students will have the option to ask questions directly through the portal. AI will attempt to resolve those queries, forwarding them to the respective teachers if necessary. Additionally, based on the data collected and students' interests, the portal will offer guidance on career paths and recommend suitable fields of study.

Furthermore, our future plans include recording lectures from urban area government schools and making them accessible to students in rural areas. AI will be used to convert these lectures into native subtitles, enabling deaf students to access educational content.

The portal will also provide information on higher studies, including college rankings, cutoff scores, available departments, and scholarships, empowering students to explore and select the best options for their future.
